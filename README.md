This is a cirucuit building sim/lab application made in QtCreator.
Originally built as a puzzle game for my groups final project in CS3505
I would like to credit my groupmates who originally worked on the project during 2nd semester junior year:
Soren Fanning, Gabe Tevis, Josh Thalathoty, and Koen Sakamoto

Now I want to make it more of a sandbox/lab for users to create, visualize, and learn basic cirucitry and logic gates.
